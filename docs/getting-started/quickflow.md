## 4. Invoice Issuance

Issue a payment invoice to a registered customer.

**Request**

```http
POST /invoice/issue
Authorization: <YOUR_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "customerId": 123,
  "customerName": "ÍπÄÎØºÏàò",
  "title": "USDT 10ÎßåÏõê Íµ¨Îß§",
  "priceAtRequest": 1350.5,
  "fiatAssetId": 1,
  "cryptoAssetId": 1001,
  "cashAmount": 100000,
  "expiredSecond": 300
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "invoice": {
    "id": "invoice-uuid-456",
    "partnerId": "partner-uuid-123",
    "amount": "100000.000000",
    "state": "Complete",
    "createdAt": "2025-08-27T09:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "url": "https://invoice.example.com/b2f1e3a4-56cd-7890-ab12-..."
}
```

üëâ The customer accesses the `url` to proceed with payment.

## 5. Webhook Processing

When payment is completed, a Webhook event is sent to the server.
The server must receive, verify, and update the payment status accordingly.

**Webhook update-transaction Example**

```json
{
  "state": "Complete",
  "customerId": 7,
  "detail": "d1f10b55e61d16e3616d8d0ac7c42e0edcc8a5587b251239f0a14f587032cb18",
  "amount": "1.229"
}
```

**Server Example (Node.js / Express)**

```javascript
app.post("/update-transaction", (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;

  // 1. Signature verification
  verifySignature(payload, req.headers["x-signature"]);

  // 2. Event processing
  if (payload.state === "Completed") {
    console.log("Payment completed:", payload.amount);
    // DB update and other processing
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```
